    <h2>Dario Portocarrero</h2>
    <p>Hello, My name is Dario Portocarrero and I am from Washington DC. I am majoring in CIT (computer information technology) and would like to know more about web development. I love working on computer hardware and various IT tasks. Learning about about history and geography is one of my hobbies. Bieng able to visit many diffrent countries is a blessing as I am able to learn and experience diffrent cultures. I mostly travel with my father, the picture is from our trip to France earlier in the year.
