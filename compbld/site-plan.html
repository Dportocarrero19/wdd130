        These are the most important parts for building a PC system. Purchase these parts at a micro center or computer store. Make sure each part will fit inside the computer case, as there can be different case and motherboard sizes. Make sure the computer parts work with each other effectively, some parts work better with certain manufacturers (intel or AMD). Handy tools for installation are a screwdriver and an anti-static wristband for sensitive electronic parts. For installation, please go to the installation page. 

        CPU - A Computer processing unit used for performing calculations, instructions and running programs. 

        Ram - (random access memory) short term memory where data is stored that needs to be used quickly

        Motherboard - Circuit board that ties all of the computer parts together and allows them to function

        Case- Shell which safeguards all important components of computer system

        CPU Cooler- device that removes heat from CPU and outside your case

        Storage drive- stores permanent computer data could be in the form of a HDD or SSD

        Power supply- Pull power from outlet and converts AC to DC voltage for system

      <h3>Installation</h3>
      <p>
        To begin building your computer system make sure to have a clean workspace and have your tools ready. Make sure to have all of your manuals open for your computer parts, as they will have handy information. Your CPU will be up first, make sure to seat the processor into the motherboard socket. Once placed, make sure to use the lever to help it stay inside. Apply thermal paste to the top of your CPU, then place the CPU cooler heat sinks on top of the CPU. Use the motherboard manual to ensure the CPU cooler is mounted correctly. Your fan will need to be plugged into the motherboard, use the manual for assistance.

        Afterwards, place the memory inside the motherboard, using the rectangular sockets. They will lock into place after you stick them in. Your motherboard manual will help show you where each will go. For your storage, find a place inside the computer case designated for HDD or SSD (this will depend on the case, use the case manual to find yours). Connect a SATA cable from your HDD/SSD to your motherboard.

        Place your motherboard inside the case, using the screw holes provided by the case. Place the power supply into the back of the computer case as well. The power supply will need to be connected to the Motherboard, storage devices and a GPU if you choose to install one. The rest of the cables can be hidden inside the case. The case will have cables of its own to fit inside the motherboard. Use the motherboard manual to see where these case cables will need to go, as they depend on both manufacturers. Finally, you can boot up your computer and install Windows. If you are unable to start your computer, there could have been something wrong during the installation process. Look at the FAQs page for more details.

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        Frequently asked questions about computer building

        How much is a PC system, and do I have to build my own?

        PC price can depend on what you want to use it for. A PC used for browning the web and managing a few applications can be in the mid hundreds, while gaming computers can reach thousands. You do not have to build your own, as there are some websites that allow you to pre-build your computer by selecting parts for them to build and ship your system.

        How long does it take to build a PC?

        Depending on your level of experience, it can take around 3-5 hours to build your computer system. I would recommend doing extensive research when building a computer with expensive parts. 

        What do I do if my computer does not turn on?

        If your computer does not turn on, there could be many different kinds of problems.First, rule out any common mistakes. Make sure each component is secured and plugged in correctly. If everything is in order, there could be a damaged part which could have been shipped. Check with the computer manufacturer.
