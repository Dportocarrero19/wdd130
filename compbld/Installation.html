                <h3>To begin building your computer system make sure to have a clean workspace and have your tools ready. Make sure to have all of your manuals open for your computer parts, as they will have handy information. Your CPU will be up first, make sure to seat the processor into the motherboard socket. Once placed, make sure to use the lever to help it stay inside. Apply thermal paste to the top of your CPU, then place the CPU cooler heat sinks on top of the CPU. Use the motherboard manual to ensure the CPU cooler is mounted correctly. Your fan will need to be plugged into the motherboard, use the manual for assistance.Afterwards, place the memory inside the motherboard, using the rectangular sockets. They will lock into place after you stick them in. Your motherboard manual will help show you where each will go. For your storage, find a place inside the computer case designated for HDD or SSD (this will depend on the case, use the case manual to find yours). Connect a SATA cable from your HDD/SSD to your motherboard.</h3>

                <h3>Place your motherboard inside the case, using the screw holes provided by the case. Place the power supply into the back of the computer case as well. The power supply will need to be connected to the Motherboard, storage devices and a GPU if you choose to install one. The rest of the cables can be hidden inside the case. The case will have cables of its own to fit inside the motherboard. Use the motherboard manual to see where these case cables will need to go, as they depend on both manufacturers. Finally, you can boot up your computer and install Windows. If you are unable to start your computer, there could have been something wrong during the installation process. Look at the FAQs page for more details.</h3>
