                <h2>How much is a PC system, and do I have to build my own?</h2>
                <h3>PC price can depend on what you want to use it for. A PC used for browning the web and managing a few applications can be in the mid hundreds, while gaming computers can reach thousands. You do not have to build your own, as there are some websites that allow you to pre-build your computer by selecting parts for them to build and ship your system.</h3>
